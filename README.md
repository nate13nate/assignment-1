> Write a python program for the following:
> - Input the string “Python” as a list of characters from console, delete at least 2 characters, reverse the resultant string and print it
> - Take two numbers from user and perform at least 4 arithmetic operations on them.

Files part1a.py and part2a.py handle the reasoning for the first and second parts, respectively, of this prompt.
The script part1.py handles combining these two functionalities into a single program, as the prompt says.
The script can be run with the following command:  
    python part1.py [stringInput] [number1] [number2]  
With stringInput being the input for part a, number1 being the first number in part b, and number2 being the second number in part b.

# Part 2

> Write a program that accepts a sentence and replace each occurrence of ‘python’ with ‘pythons’.

The script part2.py can be run with the following command:  
    python part2.py

# Part 3

> Use the if statement conditions to write a program to print the letter grade based on an input class score. Use the grading scheme we are using in this class

The script part3.py can be run with the following command:  
    python part3.py [classScore]  
With classScore being a percentage score.
